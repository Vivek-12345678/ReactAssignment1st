    <h1>1.Virtual DOM</h1>
    <p>In React, for every DOM object there is a corresponding
        "virtual DOM object".A virtual DOM object is a representation
        of DOM object,like a lightweight copy.

    </p>
    <p>A virtual DOM object has the same properties as real DOM
        object but it lacks the real thing's power to directly
        change what's on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>Manipulating the DOM is slow while virtual DOM   is fast beacuse 
        nothing gets drawn on screen.
    </p>

    <h1>2.SPA</h1>
    <p>Single Page Application is a web app implementation that
      loads only single web document, and then updates the body 
      content of that single document via a JavaScript APIs such 
      as XMLHttpRequest and fetch when different content is to be 
      shown</p>

      <br>
      <h1>3.Difference between class and functional component</h1>
      <p>Functional components are written as a JavaScript function
         whereas <mark>Class components</mark>  as a JavaScript class</p>
     <p>Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods whereas 
        <mark>Class component</mark> have a state and can implement lifecycle
        methods like Mounting,Updating,Unmounting</p>
        <p>Fnctional Component are faster as they do not have state and lifecycle whereas 
            <mark>Class Components</mark> are slower as they have state and lifecycle
        </p>

        <h1>4.State and it's use in React</h1>
        <p>React Js Statev ios a way to store and maanage the information
            or data while creating a React Application
        </p>
        <p>It allow us to manage changing data in application</p>
        <br>

        <h1>5.JSX and Why do we use it instead of js </h1>
        <p>JSX stands for JavaScript XML</p>
        <p>JSX allow us to write HTML elements in Java Script and place 
            them in DOM without any createElement() or appendChild methods
        </p>
        <p>JSX converts HTML tags into react element so it makes it easier
         to write React Application</p>

          <h1>6.What is Package.json?</h1>
          <p>Package.json is a metadata file that lists all the dependencies
            required for the project to run.It includes information such as 
            the name and version of the project, dependencies and their respective version
          </p>

          <h1>7.Difference between React and react native and which one is 
            library or framework?
          </h1>

          <p>React js is based on JavaScript while <mark>native react</mark>
        is based on objective -c or java</p>
